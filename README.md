## Psychological Case Studies

### CS-001: The Defeated Giant
**Subject:** 6th Grade P.T. Coach  
**Classification:** RETROSPECTIVE EMPATHY  
Witnessed a 10-year-old student (Shaneekwa) defy the coach's authority. Instead of anger, I saw deep defeat in his eyes. Early realization that adult authority is often a mask for unresolved childhood trauma.

### CS-002: Projection of Insecurity
**Subject:** Mr. Harp (Math Teacher)  
**Classification:** DEFENSE MECHANISM ID  
Subject frequently mocked my height. Years later, I discovered he was only 5'5". Subject was projecting his own physical insecurities onto a student to comfort his inner child. Result: Compassion, not resentment.

### CS-003: The Talking Shoes Paradox
**Subject:** Mrs. West (Social Studies)  
**Classification:** NON-VERBAL DECODING  
My shoes were falling apart ('talking'). Mrs. West, known for a miserable demeanor, held me back after class. I expected punishment; she gave me brand new Nikes. A definitive lesson that facial expressions do not always match intent.

### CS-004: The Bootcamp
**Subject:** Guardian 'Dave'  
**Classification:** RESILIENCE TRAINING  
Subjected to extreme discipline (standing in corners 30hrs+, water hose drills). Dave claimed: 'There is a method to my madness.' Though abusive, it installed a 'Navy Seal' operating system.

## Ancestral Stories

### ANS-001: The Boy and The Collie (1950s - Spurlin)
Grandfather Aldwin Byron Leo McCoy ('Leo') lived a poignant childhood on Route 6 as an only child. His closest companion was a faithful collie puppy named 'Shep'. The tragic loss of Shep, struck by a car while waiting for Leo at the bus stop, became a defining family story of loyalty and loss, echoing through the generations.

### ANS-002: The Excluded Heritage (1970s - Spurlin)
The Maternal Grandfather was of Native American descent, passing down distinct physical traits (black hair, brown eyes, dark skin) to the Subject's Mother. Because of this distinct paternity, she was treated as an outcast by her half-siblings, enduring exclusion within her own family unit.

### ANS-003: The Wolf of the Rough Bounds (1502–1584 - MacDonald)
Ian MacAlister Muiderteach MacDonald (John of Moidart) was the 8th Chief of Clanranald and a 13th great-grandfather. A warlord who defied the Scottish Crown, he secured his clan's autonomy at the Battle of the Shirts (Blàr na Léine) in 1544.

### ANS-004: The Recusant Matriarch (1598–1643 - Power)
Lady Ruth le Poer, Baroness le Pyphoe, was the chatelaine of Curraghmore House in Ireland. During the 1641 Irish Rebellion, she fled to Nansemond, Virginia to protect her unborn child, Mary Power, bridging Irish Nobility with the American Frontier.
